libvlc wrapper for Qt Quick 2/Qml.

注意 ：建议使用.pro(qmake),   因为CMakeLists.txt很多人反馈配置的不对

Requires Qt 5.x.<br>
Platform independent, and should work on any platform supported by Qt and Vlc ( but was tested only on Windows/Ubuntu Linux/Mac OS X ).

Simple usage demo is available: [QmlVlcDemo](https://github.com/RSATom/QmlVlcDemo)
